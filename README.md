# The Girl With The Shamisen 

In a remote village, a young girl was instructed to perform a ritual so that is granted to her village the favor of heaven. According to this ritual, she had to perform with her shamisen a prayer with her instrument at north altar, eventually returning to her starting point and send a final prayer to heaven at the altar of the village.
